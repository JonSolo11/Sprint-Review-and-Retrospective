How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is a necessary skill in development. Even in solo development, it's important to anticipate how the user wants to interact with your application and design with that in mind. 
When possible, it's best to create user stories to receive feedback from end users to further adapt the system to their needs. These stories can shape the vision of a current function and begin 
the breakdown of that function into smaller tasks that can be implemented. This is integral in an Agile approach but remains a necessary skill in any development situation. The breakdown of functions into 
smaller more manageable, testable tasks reduce development time by limiting roadblocks, large code refactors, while simultaneously exposing errors sooner. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My development process has changed significantly throughout my educational journey. I have learned to incorporate more planning and structure before coding to reduce scope creep and increase overall 
project vision prior to coding. When possible, I would like to incorporate more user feedback throughout development to implement feedback earlier. Very rarely are we developing code simply for our own use.
With that in mind, it’s critical to incorporate end user and stakeholder feedback throughout the process to reduce development time and deliver a product that's better suited for the intended user. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

If a developer has the skills to deliver code and the drive to learn new skills, the most critical attributes of a team member are ability to communicate, adapt to changing requirements, 
and have a positive impact on culture. Open honest communication not only impacts the product by exposing obstacles, but it also promotes a team dynamic that impacts everyone and stimulates growth. Adaptability
is a key piece in any agile environment as requirements and goals vary constantly. Culture is critical in any industry and any position. I think culture is a blend of a person's personality and their 
impact on the people around them. Although a personality can only change so much, how you interact with your team and uphold the intended culture of the company creates a ripple effect throughout
the organization that many may not realize. Skills can be learned, goals can change, but how you impact your organization daily is the most critical aspect of any team member.
